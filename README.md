# Cook-off rules

The food shall be rated according to the following criteria:

1. __Concept__, i.e. How good does the cooking implement the cook-off theme?
   Extra points for individual and fresh takes on established dishes.
2. __Visual presentation__, i.e. How good does the food look on the plate?
   Extra points if the presentation is Instagram or Pinterest-worthy.
3. __Taste__, i.e. How good does it taste?

Each category can be rated with 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 stars.
Concept is weighted with factor 1, visual presentation with factor 2 and taste with factor 3.
Hence, the maximal achievable score is 30 points.

Example:

> Alice rates Bob with 2 stars for the concept, 3 stars for the visual presentation
> and 4 stars for the taste. This means that Bob receives 2×1 + 3×2 + 4×3 = 20 points out of 30.

Juror ratings are averaged; the cook with the best points average wins.
